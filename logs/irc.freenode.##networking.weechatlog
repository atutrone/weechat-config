However, If I try to run a UDP stream to the second router, I get nothing on that router or the interface that the TAP is connected to. Thoughts?

2017-02-09 22:53:44	eatingthenight	hello, looks for some help/advice on how to automate the allocation of IP based off of the LLDP information that a machine can find on startup.

2017-02-09 22:54:44	eatingthenight	I was thinking possibly using vlan id as a way to determine where the computer is located in a datacenter
2017-02-09 22:55:09	eatingthenight	but am not sure how sound this is as i just started thinking through it
