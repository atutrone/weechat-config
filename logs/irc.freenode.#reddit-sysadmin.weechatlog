2017-02-09 22:48:17	BoredDeveloper_	and i have no freaking clue how to write unit tests for access
2017-02-09 22:48:21	catbeard	gantt charts are good too, what do they use for PM and whatnot
2017-02-09 22:48:43	catbeard	you don't need it in the cloud, git works perfectly fine in-house, even gitlab
2017-02-09 22:49:05	catbeard	access would just be ssh keys and gitlab roles
2017-02-09 22:49:13	@JollyRgrs	change control is also going to mgmt before pushing to prod
2017-02-09 22:49:24	BoredDeveloper_	catbeard: no i mean, Access the microsoft database
2017-02-09 22:49:33	catbeard	or just requiring signoffs or verified commits
2017-02-09 22:49:49	BoredDeveloper_	catbeard: Can you version control/ unit test that? I seriously didnt think you could
2017-02-09 22:50:18	catbeard	you could authorize mssql via laravel wrappers
2017-02-09 22:50:26	catbeard	and middleware classes
2017-02-09 22:50:59	catbeard	not direct but access control is access control, sure there's probably better microsofty ways of doing it
