2017-02-09 21:20:50	darkscrypt	we all have.
2017-02-09 21:20:54	darkscrypt	probably.

2017-02-09 21:21:58	darkscrypt	we upgraded the ucs chassis. 7 of the xenservers were still on xenserver 6.0 which was not compatible with the new IO modules.

2017-02-09 21:22:45	spstarr	sure, but we dont let people tough console and the tools we wrote for support prevent them from doing stupid things(tm)
2017-02-09 21:23:08	spstarr	ie, they can't decomission a VM without shutting it down and then it has to go though a process, ie they can't delete it :)
2017-02-09 21:23:31	spstarr	snapshots are protected, they can't delete automated ones only custom ones they create

2017-02-09 21:25:06	nmide	this firmware upgrade says compatible with esx 5 and 6 but theres no way you can run this
2017-02-09 21:25:24	nmide	first of all it comes as an RPM package - ok fine no big deal i can use rpm2cpio to extract it
2017-02-09 21:25:38	nmide	but then the "installer" is a shell script that depends on several utilties that are missing from esx
