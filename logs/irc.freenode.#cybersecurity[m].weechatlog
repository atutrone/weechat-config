2017-02-09 20:31:03	interfect[m]	How is a key file good? Can't people just try all the files they find in your house?

2017-02-09 21:24:01	xloem[m]	@interfect often it is encrypted with a passphrase, and kept in a secure location.  memorable strings are often guessable with today's hardware, and advertise themselves when enter them via eg keystroke noise

2017-02-09 21:30:11	+avian[m]	That's when you get creative about your keyfile ;) normally veracrypt/true crypt use only a 64bytes from a keyfile. There are many ways you can generate those 64 bytes ðŸ˜Ž.
2017-02-09 21:32:10	xloem[m]	Random is the way to go.  Humans tend to pick similar behaviors, and hackers log them and make statistical tables.
2017-02-09 21:32:34	xloem[m]	but yeah everything is a spectrum and nothing is perfect

2017-02-09 21:36:11	xloem[m]	If you're concerned about somebody searching your home for your keyfile you should read evil maid attack and switch to an open firmware system running guix
2017-02-09 21:36:11	+avian[m]	That's true ! As far as password is concerned one has to be random. As far as keyfile is concerned one need to be really creative. Having two distinct paths to open a locker gives much needed Levi for the container.
2017-02-09 21:36:11	+avian[m]	Along with that one need to make sure to clear the defaults. You don't want it (veracrypt) to prompt your password is fine but the keyfile is missing haha

2017-02-09 21:38:03	xloem[m]	Ah, you mean by creative where to store it.  Yeah unsolved issue.
2017-02-09 21:39:41	 *	xloem[m] imagines the hard drive decrypting itself by radar sonehow, verifying all the surroundings have the correct echos and resonances
2017-02-09 21:40:17	+avian[m]	Yeah hats what I was referring haha... Obvious but not obviously
2017-02-09 21:40:18	+avian[m]	Obscurely obscure and hidden in plain sight which hurts searchers ass ðŸ˜‚
2017-02-09 21:40:53	+avian[m]	Plausible !!  But those conditions can be recreated by adversaries (:
2017-02-09 21:41:13	xloem[m]	"i keep my key in the bowl of the clogged toilet, agent.  ow!  i'm telling the truth!"
2017-02-09 21:41:47	+avian[m]	Damn lol !! Good place to keep but the janitors usually know ðŸ˜Ž
2017-02-09 21:42:17	+avian[m]	I for one always thought when someone says maids ? It's LEO
2017-02-09 21:43:02	xloem[m]	i think if you get high enough frequency it gets gery hard to fake a radar signature but youd have to ensure the method of detection could not be tampered with
2017-02-09 21:44:50	xloem[m]	hard problem
2017-02-09 21:46:47	+avian[m]	High frequency = short wavelength
2017-02-09 21:46:48	+avian[m]	Means can travel longer.
2017-02-09 21:46:49	+avian[m]	Means easy to capture and replay ?
2017-02-09 21:49:57	xloem[m]	short wavelengths travel shorter.  a replay is not the same as the original because it is generated by a machine; with a digital device you have rasterization to a sampling rate which will create new harmonics.  the machine replaying would have to cancel its own signature, also with imperfection.  but if they can just put a tape recorder between the antenna and the drive its done.
2017-02-09 21:53:02	+avian[m]	Isn't tape analog ?
2017-02-09 21:53:03	+avian[m]	Wavelengths converters like ADC and DAC have now way advanced if I read it right tho.
