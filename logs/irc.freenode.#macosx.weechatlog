2017-02-09 21:36:41	DLSteve	thats not the actual vim, thats a GUI version of it.
2017-02-09 21:36:51	kode54	or vimr
2017-02-09 21:37:10	kode54	which uses an actual vim binary

2017-02-09 21:37:47	DLSteve	  /usr/bin/vim
2017-02-09 21:37:55	kode54	unless the source that apple uses themselves is part of opendarwin, it's safe and secret at their headquarters

2017-02-09 21:38:11	guyFromWeb	that's really my question
2017-02-09 21:38:12	DLSteve	Homebrew maybe
2017-02-09 21:38:13	guyFromWeb	:D
2017-02-09 21:38:22	kode54	you either install your own version in /usr/local/bin, or upgrade your macOS and hope they updated it

2017-02-09 23:27:51	Anrky	[23:24:07] Yeah, I'm behind on sleep this week so it doesn't help much
2017-02-09 23:27:51	RedSector	[23:24:36] lol, how do you get behind on sleep? 
2017-02-09 23:27:51	Anrky	[23:25:01] By not being able to sleep...
2017-02-09 23:27:51	kzismeh	[23:25:19] Just the simple reboot fixed it...I tried that at work and it didn't solve it, so thats why I didn't initially do it in this isntance 
2017-02-09 23:27:51	Anrky	[23:25:21] All work and no sleep make Anrky something, something
2017-02-09 23:27:51	RedSector	[23:25:56] kzismeh: it didnt fix it at work because it kept trying to reconnect. When you get to work tommorow it will do the same thing probubly
2017-02-09 23:27:51	tehStickMan	[23:26:00] kzismeh: no one has said the problem of that message: DHCP has failed. Since you dont control the network, not much you can try here apart from trying again
2017-02-09 23:27:51	RedSector	[23:26:45] there are ways to get around the issues at work, however they aren't recommended 
2017-02-09 23:27:51	Anrky	[23:27:05] Suck up to IT
2017-02-09 23:27:51	kzismeh	[23:27:15] I am in IT
